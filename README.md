# Format-Band-Struct-Data
A script for taking abinit outputted band structure data and making it Mathematica readable.

This python script is meant to take an output list of band eigenenergies from the abinit software package and convert it into 
Mathematica list format. Additionally in here is a Mathematica notebook that will run the Python script and automatically
bring in the data as a list. I set up a plot function as I would like to see it, and exported as an EPS.
Finally, there is also a sample 8 band calculation of crystalline silicon provided for testing.

I know of no issues currently, but if for some reason abinit changed the output formatting, this would likely break.

I tried to comment reasonably liberally, but it could very well be that the code is not very clear.  Please contact me if
you have any questions.

Please feel free to use, share, or update this code!
